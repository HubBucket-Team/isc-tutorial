# Intersubject correlation analysis tutorial
This repo accompanies the manuscript "Measuring shared responses across subjects using intersubject correlation" by Nastase, Gazzola, Hasson, and Keysers. It includes a Jupyter Notebook tutorial introducing basic intersubject correlation (ISC) analyses and statistical tests as implemented in Python using the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit ([BrainIAK](http://brainiak.org/)). The notebook uses both simulated data and a publicly available fMRI dataset. Using Google Colaboratory, you can run the analyses in the tutorial notebook entirely in the cloud. To navigate directly to the notebook on Google Colab, [click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/snastase/isc-tutorial/blob/master/isc_tutorial.ipynb).

This notebook is geared towarad relative newcomers to ISC analysis with some Python familiarity. The tutorial introductory treatment of the following topics:
* Computing ISCs
* Computing ISFCs
* Statistical tests for ISCs
* Correcting for multiple tests
* Loading and visualizing fMRI data
